This blog is an attempt to document my transition from engineering to datascience.
Through these posts I try to connect dots, piece together knowledge from my experience and learning to satiate my own curiosity. 
Hope you find something useful or relevant to your interests here. 
I am interested in working on projects that have social and environmental benefits. 
Please reach out if you have any comments/ideas.
