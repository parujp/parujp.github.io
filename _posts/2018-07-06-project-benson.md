### Background
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) International is organizing an annual gala at the beginning of Summer 2018. WTWY is interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of their street team work, which is a significant portion of their fund-raising efforts. Being a new and inclusive organization, WTWY tries to do double duty with the gala both to fill the event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach. 
To do this, they are planning to place street teams at entrances to subway stations to collect email addresses. Those who sign up are sent free tickets to the WTWY gala.
### Challenge
Using the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York) Data pertaining to Subways, help WTWY optimize the placement of street teams to gather most signatures from those who will attend the gala and contribute to the cause.
